Using a Seasonal ARIMA Model to Predict ISP Revenue

## Purpose

At a very high level, the upper-most tiers of leadership including the board of directors of an ISP may be interested in a quick summary of overall revenue trends. Seasonal fluctuations and possible predictions for future time periods should be available for such a broad measure after the first 2 years of operations.

An analyst or data scientist may begin their approach to such an insight driven task by asking themselves if there exists any periodic repetetiveness over time for overall revenue. During the first 2 years of operations is there a significant difference in the revenenue for Q2 from the other quarters or seasons? Perhaps a more interesting report would say whether revenue is expected to increase in future months. Crucial decisions regarding investor engagement and top-down reorganization of the company may impinge upon these results.
